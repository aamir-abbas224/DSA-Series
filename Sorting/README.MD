- **Merge Sort** – It is a recursive algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach. It involves breaking problems into sub-problems and then combining the result.
                    The merge sort algorithm consists of three simple steps:
                          1. Recursively sort the left half of the input array.
                          2. Recursively sort the right half of the input array.
                          3. Merge two sorted sub arrays into one.
