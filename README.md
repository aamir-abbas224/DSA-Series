# DSA-Series
A repository of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts implemented in Python.  
This repo serves as a learning and reference resource, covering **definitions, explanations**, and eventually **implementations** of basic to advanced algorithms.

## **Definations** & **Explanations**:

i. **Data Structures**: They can be defined as a way or formating, storing or structuring data or information effectively and efficiently.

ii. **Algorithms**: An algorithm is a finite sequence of precise instructions for performing a computation or for
solving a problem.
  - **PROPERTIES OF ALGORITHMS**:
  - **Input**. An algorithm has input values from a specified set.
  -  **Output**. From each set of input values an algorithm produces output values from a specified
     set. The output values are the solution to the problem.
  - **Definiteness**. The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.
  - **Correctness**. An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input
    values.
  - **Finiteness**. An algorithm should produce the desired output after a finite (but perhaps
    large) number of steps for any input in the set.
  - **Effectiveness**. It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a
    finite amount of time.
  - **Generality**. The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired form, not
    just for a particular set of input values.
    
iii.**Algorithms Design Paradigm**
  i. Divide and Conquer
  ii. Greedy Algorithms
  iii. Dynamic Programming

iv.**Growth Function**
  - **Big-O Notation**
    

    
  - **Big-Omega Notation**


  - **Big Theta Notation**



## Purpose

This repository is designed to document my DSA journey.  
It will include:
- Core DSA concepts and definitions
- Problem-solving approaches
- Python implementations (to be added gradually)

The goal is to consolidate learning, track progress, and provide a reference for both myself and others.

## Concepts Covered

- **Arrays** – Collection of elements stored in contiguous memory, supports indexing and iteration.  
- **Strings** – Sequence of characters, immutable in Python.  
- **Linked Lists** – Nodes connected via pointers, supporting efficient insertions/deletions.  
- **Stacks & Queues** – Abstract data types for LIFO and FIFO operations.  
- **Trees** – Hierarchical structures, including Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees.  
- **Graphs** – Collections of nodes connected by edges, directed or undirected.  
- **Dynamic Programming** – Optimization technique using memoization or tabulation.  
- **Greedy Algorithms** – Making local optimal choices to find a global optimum.  
- **Sorting & Searching** – Algorithms for ordering and finding elements efficiently.  
- **Recursion & Backtracking** – Solving problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

> Each concept will eventually include **Python code implementations** with example problems and complexity analysis.
