# DSA-Series

A repository for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts implemented in Python.  
This repo serves as both a **learning resource** and **reference guide**, covering definitions and eventually **implementations** of basic to advanced algorithms.  
The repository is organized into sub-parts for easier navigation and reference.

## **Definitions & Explanations**

### i. Data Structures

Data structures are ways of **formatting, storing, or structuring data** efficiently to enable effective operations on it.

### ii. Algorithms

An algorithm is a **finite sequence of precise instructions** for performing computations or solving problems.

#### **Properties of Algorithms**

- **Input**: Receives input values from a specified set.  
- **Output**: Produces output values that solve the problem.  
- **Definiteness**: Steps must be precisely defined.  
- **Correctness**: Produces correct outputs for all valid inputs.  
- **Finiteness**: Terminates after a finite number of steps.  
- **Effectiveness**: Each step can be executed in finite time.  
- **Generality**: Applicable to all problems of the desired form, not just specific inputs.

### iii. Algorithm Design Paradigms

- **Divide and Conquer**: Break problems into sub-problems, solve independently, then combine.  
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Make locally optimal choices to solve optimization/combinatorial problems.  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Reuse intermediate results when sub-problems overlap to improve efficiency.

### iv. Recursion

A method where a function **calls itself** to solve smaller instances until a **base case** is reached.  

- **Base Case**: Stops recursion.  
- **Recursive Case**: Function calls itself with simpler input.  

> ⚠️ Note: Excessive recursion can cause a **StackOverflow** error.

### v. Backtracking

A form of recursion used when multiple choices exist at each step.  

- Explores all possibilities, pruning paths that cannot yield a solution.  

### vi. Asymptotic Analysis

Characterizes an algorithm’s runtime:  

- **Worst Case**: Slowest performance  
- **Best Case**: Fastest performance  
- **Average Case**: Expected performance on random inputs

### vii. Growth Functions

## **Purpose**

This repository documents my DSA journey and will include:  

- Core **DSA concepts and definitions**  
- **Python implementations** (added gradually)  

The goal is to consolidate learning, track progress, and provide a reference for both myself and others.

> Each concept will eventually include **Python code implementations**.
> File and navigation structure will be added once the basic DSA has been added.
